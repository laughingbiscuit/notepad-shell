A bunch of my learnings in one place. Each code
block is run in a pipeline, so you can be sure that 
it works.

# Sample Usage

## Simple Shell

```sh
$SIMPLE_SHELL
```

## Simple API

```sh
$SIMPLE_API
```
## Reference

```sh
$REF
```

## Secret

Read a secret from GitHub. This will be masked
in the logs, but not here in the output. Be careful!

```sh
$USE_SECRET
```
